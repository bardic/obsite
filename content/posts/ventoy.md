If you find yourself making bootable usbs more often than like once a month, look into [ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net).

Make's a bootable usb that has a partition for you to just drag and drop iso's into. So when you boot to this drive you actually boot to the ventoy OS that gives you an UI to simply just select the iso to you want to boot into. Great stuff.
